# versioningStudies

### Test repository. Used to study version control with Git and GitHub.

Hi everyone! I created this project in order to really grasp all the functionalities of Git and GitHub.

I'll use this repository to test:
* commit-pull-push flow
* github actions
* collaborations
* github wiki

:)

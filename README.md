# versioningStudies

### Test repository. Used to study version control with Git and GitHub.

Hi everyone! I created this project in order to practice with the most important functionalities of Git and GitHub.

I used this repository to study:
* commit-pull-push flow
* branch control
* github actions
* collaborations
* github wiki
